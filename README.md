### Description

This is a demo program showing how someone could make a lemmings type game. This code uses bitblt with regular timers and is quite slow (because of regular timers). Check out the other version I will post with ccrp timers. Note: I do not have any affiliation with the creators of the game Lemmings, nor is this program complete, I just made it for fun.
 
### More Info
 
If you have a slow computer, your computer may crash.
